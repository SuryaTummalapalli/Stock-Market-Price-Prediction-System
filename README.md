Certainly! Here's a professional and detailed README file you can include with your improved Streamlit Stock Market Price Prediction project:

# Stock Market Price Prediction System

A Streamlit web app that predicts future stock closing prices using two machine learning models: Random Forest Regressor and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). The app features interactive visualizations, adjustable model parameters, and downloadable results in CSV format.

## Features

- Select popular stocks or enter custom tickers using Yahoo Finance data
- Choose prediction model: Random Forest or LSTM neural network
- Configure model parameters including lag days and LSTM lookback window
- Predict stock closing prices for the next *N* business days (up to 14)
- Visualize historical and predicted data with Plotly interactive charts and Matplotlib plots
- View model performance with Train and Test RMSE metrics
- Download historical + predicted data or only predictions as CSV files
- Responsive, user-friendly UI with tooltips and validation to prevent invalid inputs
- Caching for faster repeat data fetch and model training
- Color-coded performance highlights and detailed prediction summaries
- Shows last update timestamp for transparency

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-prediction-streamlit.git
   cd stock-prediction-streamlit
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   # OR
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the Streamlit app locally with:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open the URL shown in your terminal (usually http://localhost:8501/) in your web browser.

## How It Works

- The app downloads historical stock data for the selected ticker and date range using [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/).
- For Random Forest:
  - Creates lag features from historical close prices.
  - Trains a Random Forest regression model on 80% of historical data.
  - Predicts the next *N* days iteratively.
- For LSTM:
  - Scales close prices using MinMaxScaler.
  - Uses sliding windows of past close prices as input sequences.
  - Trains an LSTM neural network and predicts future prices.
- Both models display performance metrics (RMSE on train and test sets).
- Visualization includes historical prices, moving averages (MA20 and MA50), and predicted prices.
- Users can download combined or prediction-only CSV files.

## Project Structure

- `app.py` — Main Streamlit app script
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
- `README.md` — Documentation (this file)

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7+
- streamlit
- yfinance
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- keras / tensorflow
- plotly
- matplotlib

See `requirements.txt` for exact versions.

## Known Limitations

- LSTM model training occurs on the fly — may take a few seconds depending on your machine.
- No authentication implemented; intended for local or internal use.
- Prediction accuracy depends on historical data quality and model parameters.

## Future Improvements

- Add real-time stock prices using streaming APIs.
- Include additional models and automatic model selection.
- Implement confidence intervals or prediction uncertainty.
- Deploy to Streamlit Cloud or Heroku for public access.
- Add user authentication and logging.
